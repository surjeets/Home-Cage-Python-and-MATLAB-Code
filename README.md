# Python Code
Python code folder has two sub directories **Animal_Motion** and **track animal** that corresponds to **Algorithm 1** and **Algorithm 2** explained in the manuscript.

These codes can be used for motion detection and tracking animal activity in the home-cage.

# MATLAB Code
MATLAB code can be used to plot the actograms and score inactivity periods of the animal in home-cage. Futher, an experimenter can compare the video actogram with tethered LFP/EMG recordings.
